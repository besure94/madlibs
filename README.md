## Madlibs

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A webpage allowing users to create a Madlib.

## Description

This webpage allows users to input variables into a form, which will string them together into a sentence that will display upon submission of the form.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.

## Known Bugs

The webpage lacks any kind of CSS styling. I would like to add to this later on when I have the time. I also would like to create different sentence structures for the variables that are inputted.
